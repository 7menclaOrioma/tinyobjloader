Swapping models can be fun and creative, but it also requires some tools and knowledge. In this article, we will show you how to swap models in Resident Evil 6 PC using a tutorial video from YouTube[^2^] and a modding website called Nexus Mods[^1^]. We will also give you some tips and warnings before you start modding.
 
## What You Need
 
Before you start swapping models, you need to have the following things:
 
- A copy of Resident Evil 6 PC installed on your computer.
- A backup of your game files in case something goes wrong.
- A program called Fluffy Manager 5000, which is a mod manager that can install and uninstall mods for various games, including Resident Evil 6. You can download it from Nexus Mods[^1^].
- A program called RE6 Model Swap Trainer, which is a tool that can swap models in real time while playing the game. You can also download it from Nexus Mods[^1^].
- Some model swap mods that you want to use. You can find many of them on Nexus Mods[^1^] or other modding websites. Make sure they are compatible with your game version and Fluffy Manager 5000.

## How to Swap Models
 
Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps to swap models in Resident Evil 6 PC:

1. Run Fluffy Manager 5000 and select Resident Evil 6 as your game. Then, click on the Mods List tab and install the model swap mods that you want to use. You can also uninstall them later if you want to revert back to the original models.
2. Run RE6 Model Swap Trainer and select your game executable (re6.exe) from the drop-down menu. Then, click on the Load button and wait for the trainer to load your game data.
3. Start your game and load your save file or start a new game. Then, press F1 to open the trainer menu. You will see a list of categories and subcategories that contain different models that you can swap.
4. Select the category and subcategory that correspond to the model that you want to change. For example, if you want to change Leon's model, select Player -> Leon -> Default. Then, select the model that you want to use instead of the original one. For example, if you want to use Chris's model from Resident Evil 5, select Chris -> RE5 -> BSAA.
5. Press F1 again to close the trainer menu and enjoy your new model. You can also press F2 to toggle between your original model and your swapped model at any time.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for any other models that you want to swap. You can also save your settings by pressing F5 and load them later by pressing F9.

## Tips and Warnings
 
Swapping models can be fun and creative, but it also has some limitations and risks. Here are some tips and warnings that you should keep in mind before modding:

- Some models may not work properly or cause glitches or crashes. This may depend on your game version, your system specifications, or the quality of the mod. Always backup your game files before modding and uninstall any mods that cause problems.
- Some models may not match the animations or voice lines of the original characters. This may result in awkward or funny situations, such as Leon doing Chris's moves or Ada speaking like Jake. You may also encounter some clipping issues or texture errors.
- Some models may not be suitable for certain scenarios or cutscenes. For example, swapping Leon with Ada may break some scripted events or cause inconsistencies in the story. You may also see some duplicate characters or missing characters if you swap them with someone else.
